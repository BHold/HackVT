# Vermont Livability Index

The Vermont Livability Index is a project started during the [2013 HackVT hackathon](http://hackvt.com/), held at MyWebGrocer in Winooski, VT.

The project intends to determine the "livability" of Vermont towns based on a variety of criteria. Each of the criteria is backed by data from the Vermont Center for Rural Studies and Vermont Housing Data. Users can also weight the criteria based on their personal preferences and concerns, in order to calculate a personal livability index and identify their ideal towns.
